*"Enzyme.txt" contains the data set for problems 1 and 2. If ZinR is a random variable, the notation Z ~ (mu, v) is such that E(Z) = mu and Var(Z) = v.*

## Problem 1

*In an enzyme kinetics study the velocity of a reaction (Y) is expected to be related to the concentration (X) as follows:*

![](prob1.png)

*(a) We must first obtain starting points for Gauss-Newton to be able to estimate gamma0 and gamma1. Observe that*

*Use this to obtain starting points for Gauss-Newton.*  

With some fenegling of the function presented above we can see that gamma0 will be our scaling factor and -gamma1 will be our vertical asymptote.

*(b) Estimate gamma0 and gamma1 using the starting points obtained in part (a).*

Since as X ->  infinity Y -> 1/infinity, we see that gamma0 will approach the max value of Y so gamma0 should start at max(Y) = 21.6. The gamma0 starting point can be 0 because the denominator cannot be 0, and since all of Xi is positive, gamma0 has to be > -Xi.

```{r}
model.start = nls(Y ~ gamma0*X / (gamma1 + X), data = enzyme, 
                  start = list(gamma0 = 21.6, gamma1 = 0))
gamma.hat = model.start$m$getAllPars()
gamma.hat
```

From the starting points and running the model we get gamma0-hat = 28.14 and gamma1-hat = 12.57.


## Problem 2

Refer to the analysis of the enzyme kinetics in problem 1:

*(a) Plot the estimated nonlinear regression function and data on the same graph. Does the fit appear to be adequate?*

```{r}
plot(enzyme$X, enzyme$Y, xlab = "X", ylab = "Y", main = "Enzyme data with Model Fit")
lines(enzyme$X, model.start$m$fitted(), col = "red")
```

The fit using the starting points above appears to fit the data very well.

*(b) Plot the residuals against the fitted values and obtain the normal qq-plot. Comment on the fit of the model.*

```{r}
plot(model.start$m$fitted(), model.start$m$resid(), xlab = "Fitted values", 
     ylab = "Residuals", main = "Residuals vs. Fitted Values")
abline(h = 0, col = "red", lty = 3)

qqnorm(model.start$m$resid(), ylab = "Residuals")
qqline(model.start$m$resid(), col ="red")
```

The residuals against the fitted values show equal variance, and the normal qq-plot shows the data just about hugs the qq-line, which means our assumptions are satisfied and our model fit is appropriate.

*(c) Assume that the fitted model is appropriate and that large sample inference can be employed. Report the test statistic and two-sided p-value of the test of H0: gamma1 = 20.*

```{r}
J = model.start$m$gradient()
sigma2 = sum(model.start$m$resid()^2)/(nrow(J) - ncol(J))
se.gamma1 = sqrt(sigma2)*sqrt( solve(t(J)%*%J)[2,2] )
n = 18

gamma1 = gamma.hat[2]
t = (gamma1 - 20) / se.gamma1
p.val = 2*pt(-abs(t), df = n-1)
t; p.val
```

With a test statistic of -9.73 and a p-value of 2.3e-08, we can reject the H0 and conclude that gamma1 is not equal to 20.


##Problem 3

*Refer to the analysis of the enzyme kinetics in problems 1 and 2. Perform a bootstrap with 1000 samples, and compute 95% percentile confidence intervals for gamma1. Is it close to the confidence interval based on the large sample theory?*

```{r}
gamma_function = function(data, i){
 d2 = data[i,] 
 model = nls(Y ~ gamma0*X / (gamma1 + X), data = d2, start = list(gamma0 = 21, gamma1 = 0))
 gammahat = model$m$getAllPars()
 return(gammahat[2])
}

bootstrap_gamma1 = boot(enzyme, gamma_function, R = 1000)
boot.ci(boot.out = bootstrap_gamma1, conf = .95, type = "norm")

# large sample theory
CI.gamma1 = gamma.hat[2] + c(-1,1)*se.gamma1*qt(p = 0.975, df = nrow(J)-ncol(J))
CI.gamma1
```

After 1000 bootstrap samples, the bootstrap CI is (11.24, 14.07). Compared to the CI using the design matrix above, our bootstrap CI is narrower (i.e., better).
